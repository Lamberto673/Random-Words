# 🎲 Random-Words

Welcome to **Random-Words**, a collection of small experimental projects where I play with randomness and improve my Python, PyQt5, and C++ skills.  
This is a space for learning, messing around, and growing — feedback is always welcome!

🪟 GUI Projects Built with PyQt5

These are desktop apps I've built to learn how to use signals, slots, widgets, and layout management:

- **Timer.py** – A start/stop timer interface
- **calculator.py** – A basic calculator app
- **projectclick.py** – A click counter (WIP)

🧠 Purpose

This project is purely for learning and experimenting.  
No matter how rough it is — feedback, criticism, and suggestions are always appreciated.
